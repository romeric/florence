THIS IS A SLIGHTLY MODIFIED VERSION OF IGAKIT.
MAINLY THE FORTRAN BSP MODULE WAS MODIFIED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUT
SECOND DERIVATIVES OF NURBS CURVE AND WAS RECOMPILED.

THE RECOMPILATION WAS DONE USING: 
1. TO GET PYF FILE

	f2py -h igalib.pyf -m igalib igalib.f90

2. MODIFIED PYF FILE LINE check(p>=1) to check(p>=0) FOR EVALUATE SUBROUTINE
3. COMPILED TO SHARED LIBRARY AGAIN FROM THE MODIFIED PYF FILE AS

	f2py -c igalib.pyf igalib.f90

4. WHICH CREATED THE igalib.so
