WHERE FUNCTIONS IS A FASTER IMPLEMENTATION OF numpy.where IN CYTHON.
THE FUNCTIONS WERE COMPILED USING: python setup.py build_ext --inplace
HOWEVER BE CAREFUL WITH THE USAGE OF THESE FUNCTIONS AS BOUNDS CHECKING ARE TURNED OFF.
IMPORTANTLY:
	1. THE OUTPUT RESULTS ARE TUPLE AND NOT np.array (USE np.asarray(output) FOR CONVERSION)
	2. THEY ONLY WORK WITH FLOATING POINT INPUTS
